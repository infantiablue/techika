I was learning Web Dev and hope to be a front end web developer soon, and I believe the best way is to practice. Then I made this project with some technology which could be quite complicated for such a simple site, but I can learn a lot from that. The site basically let you convert any YT video less than 10 mins (you can configure in source code) to MP3 files, save it to DropBox, basic profile with history. It has been published on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/k003t6/a_complete_web_app_to_convert_youtube_videos_to/) community.

Here are some tech tools have been used:

* Flask, SQLAlchemy, Flask-Dance
* Google Cloud Logging 
* Custom Web Socket Server for progess bar
* VueJS, WebPack, Bootstrap for front end
* PostgreSQL
* PyTest
* Social Authentication 
* I also experiment with Google Cloud Firestore, which you can find in web/gdata folder
* Supervisor, gunicorn with Nginx set up for production hosting

The project has been developed to experiment with Vue 3 and Vite. To make it simple for the learning purpose, the goal is just to receive the top articles from Hacker News and load it from the client side. It has been published on [Medium](https://infantiablue.medium.com/hackernews-reader-with-vue-3-vite-2-and-vuex-4-part-1-247315ceb06a) as tutorials.
